# Google SMTP server settings
#
# Since the authentication takes place over a TLS encrypted connection,
# gmail requires `PLAIN` SMTP authentication with its servers. This can
# be stated using `set smtp_authenticators="plain"`, but there is no
# need to be that explicit.
#
# On Fedora systems, mutt needs SASL libraries to do this kind of PLAIN
# authentication. Unfortunately, these are not direct dependencies of
# the mutt RPM package and needs to be separately installed using:
#
#   $ sudo yum -y install cyrus-sasl-plain
#
# Not installing the above package will lead to the "No authenticators
# found" mutt error upon sending any email over SMTP..
